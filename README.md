A SourceMod plugin to bridge [Dystopia](https://store.steampowered.com/app/17580/Dystopia/) and [Discord](https://discordapp.com/). The release includes a SourceMod plugin with the required extension files and a Node.js bot application which is run separately from the game server. There is currently no working Discord API that works with Dystopia which is why the bot is seperated into it's own application.

## Features

Two-way chat between Dystopia and a Discord channel.

Shows the server's player count as the bot activity.

Sends an automated message in the chat with an invite to the Discord server.

Ability for those with admin permissions in the Discord server to use server commands via Discord.

Posts other events in the Discord channel such as objectives, map changes and kills.

Shows server information in the channel topic.

## Installation
